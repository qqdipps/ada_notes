  GOALS :
    √ Understand that, at Ada, in order to submit projects, each person will need to fully open an appropriate Pull Request

    √ A Pull Request will require each person to fork the repo from an organization to their personal account, to make code changes, and then to open the PR

    √ Understand that each PR should be appropriately named, and should have answers to the comprehension questions
