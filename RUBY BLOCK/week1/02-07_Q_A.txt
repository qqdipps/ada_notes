Intro to Data Structures: Arrays and Hashes


Question: Why do we interpolate when printing the whole array? 
What is the difference between puts students and puts "#{students}"?

2.5.1 :009 > puts ["one", "two"]
one
two
 => nil
2.5.1 :010 > puts "#{["one", "two"]}"
["one", "two"]
 => nil  

What different ways are there to access the last element in an array?
array[-1]
array[(array.length - 1)]

Given an array with the age of each person in the class,
How would you find the average age?
How would you find the biggest or smallest age?
see 02-07_test.rb LINES 44-68

Questions
Does it make sense to access the "last" key/value pair in a hash?
NO ->  the order is not guaranteed

What data type do you get back from my_hash.keys?
an array of all the keys in the hash

How would you get a list of fruits costing less than $3.00?

Exercise: Hash or Array?
Determine whether you would use an array or a hash to store each of these collections and why.

The types of tea you have in your cupboard

hash -> label info

An address
array -> single thing
